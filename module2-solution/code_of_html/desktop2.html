You say that you love rain,<br />
but you open your umbrella when it rains...<br />
You say that you love the sun,<br />
but you find a shadow spot when the sun shines.<br />
You say that you love the wind,<br />
But you close your window when wind blows.<br />
This is why I am afraid;<br />
You say that you love me too.<br />

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br />
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br />
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br />
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br />
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br />
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br />
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.<br />
     So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br />

I love you once<br />
I love you twice<br />
I love you more than beans and rice<br />
I love you blue<br />
I love you green<br />
I love you more than peach ice cream<br />
I love you north, south, east and west<br />
You are the one I love the best<br />
